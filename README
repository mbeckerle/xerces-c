project and other documentation.

## Build Hints

- libtool is needed (libtoolize command is used)
- In the process below you may see compilation-time warnings when it is compiling C++ code (down casts, number magnitudes, etc. )
These can safely be ignored.
No ERRORS are acceptable however.
- The steps are:

1. reconf # A script that runs all the pre-configuration steps.
2. ./configure --disable-depenency-tracking # creates make files.
3. make # compiles and makes the xerces-c libraries
4. make check # builds and runs built in tests.
Look in test-results.log for test output.

If satisfied, recommended usage is NOT to install these libraries, but rather add the
src/.libs directory to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, in a script that runs the application that needs this
specific library.

Installing this library (via sudo make install) will overwrite whatever OS version you had installed previously, which
may be newer than the one you are building here. This is not recommended.
